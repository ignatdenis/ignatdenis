## 📂 Highlighted Projects

### 📈 Math Function Visualizer
A C++ application designed to calculate, render, and visualize mathematical functions. This project demonstrates applied mathematics, logic, and rendering capabilities.

### 🧵 Custom String Library
A ground-up recreation of the standard C `cstring` library (featuring custom implementations for splitting, concatenation, and memory manipulation). Implemented in both C++ and C# to deepen my understanding of pointer arithmetic, memory management, and algorithmic efficiency.
